# Advent of Code

To run, `cd` into a `year` folder, then a `day` folder, and run 
```bash
make run
```

This should print out the solutions for Part 1 and Part 2 for the corresponding day and year. 

Currently only includes a few daily solutions for 2023.

## Different inputs
Currently, each daily folder has an `input.txt` file which contains my unique input. If you want to try out my code for a different input, simply change that file. 

Note however, that some solutions might have constants that specify the number of lines, or another input-specific parameter. You will need to update them if necessary.
